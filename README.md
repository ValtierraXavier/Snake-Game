# HTML Canvas Classic Snake

##### Using the HTML Canvas API to create a Snake game.
## What is a Snake Game?
Snake is a simple game with simple rules:
- The snake starts off as just a head. There is also a bit of food.
- The snake head is always moving in a direction (except on pause...but im gettting ahead of myself).
- You can control the snake head's direction (Left, Right, Up, Down)
- The snake is very hungry...always hungry. Feed the snake.
- When the snake eats the food, it grows, adding the food to its tail.
- You lose when you hit the edge of the game area or if you eat your own tail...dont do that.
